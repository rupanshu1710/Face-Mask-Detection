# Face-Mask-Detection

####The objective is to developed a Binary Image Classifier Model that detects faces and classify them on the basics of Face-Masks.
-This system can therefore be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Covid-19. 
-This project can be integrated with embedded systems for application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and public places to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed.
